In this notebook, compared to my previous starter notebooks we teach 5 new things:\n","* How to tranform `efs` and `efs_time` into single target with `KaplanMeierFitter`.\n","* How to train `GPU LightGBM model` with `KaplanMeierFitter` target\n","* How to train `XGBoost with Survivial:Cox loss`\n","* How to train `CatBoost with Survival:Cox loss`\n","* How to ensemble 5 models using `scipy.stats.rankdata()`.\n","\n","# Two Competition Approaches\n","In this competition, there are two ways to train a Survival Model:\n","* We can input both `efs` and `efs_time` and train a **model that supports** `survival loss like Cox`.\n","* Transform `efs` and `efs_time` into a single target proxy for `risk score` and train **any model** with `regression loss like MSE`.\n","\n","In this notebook, we train 5 models. The first 3 models (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) use bullet point two. And the next 2 models (XGBoost Cox, CatBoost Cox) use bullet point one. Discussion about this notebook is [here][4] and [here][3]. \n","\n","Since this competition's metric is a ranking metric, we ensemble the 5 predictions by first converting each into ranks using `scipy.stats.rankdata()`. Afterward we created a weighted average from the ranks.\n","\n","Have Fun! Enjoy!\n","\n","# Previous Notebooks\n","My previous starter notebooks are:\n","* XGBoost and CatBoost starter [here][1]\n","* NN (MLP) starter [here][2]\n","\n","Associated discussions are [here][3],
